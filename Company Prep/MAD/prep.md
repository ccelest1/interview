# Interview Prep

## Interview Plan
### Tuesday
* Mock #1
    - First full system design interview
        * Listen carefully -> clarify reqs, ask user questions + constraints + expectations
        * Focus on outline of clear comms, logical step by step design process
    - Write down areas of improvement, top strengths

### Wednesday
* Mock #2
    - Iterate on Monday
        * Attempt new approach if needed
        * Practice walking through classic sys design practices
            - Scalable architectures
                * Load balancers, caching, data modeling, RESTful API design
            - Trade-offs
                * Performance vs cost, horizontal v vertical scaling
            - Gain feedback on strategic thinking

### Thursday
- Consolidate learning
    1. Revisit 2-3 sys design patterns correlated to JS/TS apps (microservices, client-server architecture)
    2. Practice mock solo session, bullet points for intro-ing clarifying questions, outlining design
    3. Read guide/watch video on collab design (interview setting)
    4. Self-assess

- Simulate close to Friday interview for mock
    * Focus heavily on collaboration -> respond to suggestions, discuss trade-offs
    * Practice defending choices, adapting ideas from others

### Ongoing Habits
- (After mock interviews)
    * Update 'system design interview' 1 pager:
        * Most successful techniques
        * Areas for improvement
        * Key system comps and collaboration language
- Each night perform recap, targeted review
