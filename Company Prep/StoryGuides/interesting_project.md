# Purpose
- Interviewer through question determines if I've done any significant dev work, potential seniority

    * Story ready:
        - Technical Capability
        - Leadership
        - Impact
        - Potential

# Good Answer Example
- At former company I worked on a NodeJS/Express backend application
- I was one of 3 developers tasked with creating new API routes to support fts like delivering recipe info to end users w/ geo-location
    - API req auth, rotating keys
    - Updated test suite to run faster during dev from 2 minutes to 30 seconds
        * Increased speed of local dev, ultimate delivery
- Learned
    * Running tests concurrently can save tons of time

## Examples of Impressive Tech Achievements
- Optimizations: Numbers backing up improvements (ex: sped up problematic query by x%)
- Introduced a new process: (Ex: Automate eslint fixes in code pipeline)
- Greenfield features: (Ex: Created widget/page for existing site)
- Migrations: (Ex: port AngularJS to ReactJS)
- Bugs: (Ex: Critical issue req complex fix)
