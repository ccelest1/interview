# Smallest Substring of All Characters
## __Prompt__
- Given an array of unique characters arr and a string str, Implement a function getShortestUniqueSubstring that finds the smallest substring of str containing all the characters in arr.
- (Base Case) Return "" (empty string) if such a substring doesnâ€™t exist.
 - Solution also accounts for edge cases where str is empty, str is shorter than array, when going through string there is no elements from array in a row or no elements that appear in str that are in the array at all
## Analyze Space and Time Complexity
- Come up with an asymptotically optimal solution and analyze the time and space complexities.
