## [4SUM](https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/description/)

### Problem
> Given an array `nums` of `n` integers -> return array of all unique quadruplets `[[
    nums[a],
    nums[b],
    nums[c],
    nums[d]
],...]`
> Where `0 <= a, b, c, d < n`, `a,b,c,d` are distinct, and `nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d] == target` (?)

### Analysis
- Input: Given an array list[int], and target int

- Output: Return quadruplets, list[list[int], list[int],...]

- Algo Process
    - Restate Problem
        * Given an array and a numerical target, return quads that each sum up to target

    - Goal of Function
        * Need to return all unique quadruplets summing up to defined target

    - Types
        * list, int

    - Assertions and Assumptions
        * given a list of integers, int target
        * not given alpha characters, potentially given an unfeasible target

    - Edge Cases (regardless of assertions, assumptions)
        * given an array of integers that will never sum up to the target


#### Example \#1
```py
Input: nums = [1,0,-1,0,-2,2], target = 0
Output: [[-2,-1,1,2],[-2,0,0,2],[-1,0,0,1]]
```

#### Example \#2
```py
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], target = 8
Output: [[2,2,2,2]]
```

#### Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `-109 <= target <= 109`

#### Reflecting on Attempt:
- Attempted problem on `tryexp` platform and was stumped about how to do it -> end up executing on broken code that had the right idea but just incorrect implementation
- needed to (if able to execute correctly), state tc, sc

### [Neetcode]()
- [Neetcode Solution](nc.py)
#### TC, SC

- #### NC Notes
- similar to 3 sum problem (will need to review) as well as two sum ii
- Need to think most about not returning redundant arrays
    - use two pointers and then decrement or increment in already sorted array if we need a smaller/larger value for the next two values to get to target with other two values
    - two for loops then a while loop
        * first for first value, second for second value, while loop `while l<r` to determine third and fourth at n cubed tc
> Will use recursion as problem gets at the desire for creating a generic solution i.e K-Sum
